Innerclasses
======================

Innerclasses are not supported by SWIG and simply ignored. 

There is a known workaround to this, which we aim to implement:

http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_nested_classes

This approach has a small pitfall when the "Outer" class has a sibling with the same name as its "Inner" class.
This case is detected by EasySwig the innerclass is ignored (SWIG default behaviour).
We also ignore innerclasses with no public constructor/destructors.
