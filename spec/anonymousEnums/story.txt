Anonymous Enums
======================

enum {
	value1, value2, ..
};

Such 'Anonymous' Enums are parsed by Doxygen with a weird name (for instance @13). Doxyparser replaces this value through something like '_Enum2'

Additionally:
- Named Enums are wrapped as Classes and include their values
- Anonymous Enums are correctly wrapped as Enums and given a name
