Project example showing how to use EasySwig (use as template for other projects)
=========================================



Mandatory components:

- A subfolder named 'include' with the header files you want to wrap
- A CSV file named 'api.csv' with the name of the namespace you want to wrap and classes to wrap/ignore

Optional components:

- A file (optionally named custom_config.i) with %include statements for those header files found in subdirectories (otherwise SWIG won't find them)


Execute EasySwig:

1. Move to this folder
> cd spec/Example

2. Generate Doxygen XML Intermediate representation. Found in generated subfolder: 'easy-swig/doxygen'
> sh ../../bin/easyswig.sh doxygen

3. Generate SWIG Interface Files (.i). Found in generated subfolder: 'easy-swig/generate'
> sh ../../bin/easyswig.sh generate

4. Generate Wrappers using your installed version of SWIG. Found in generated subfolder: 'easy-swig/swig'
> sh ../../bin/easyswig.sh swig
