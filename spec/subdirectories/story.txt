Subdirectories
======================

EasySwig will find header files in subdirectories.
Preprocessor macros defined in these files must also be expanded by SWIG during the wrapper's generation.

In order to do this, the headers must be made visible to SWIG. The config file (custom_config.i) can be used for this task:

/* File : custom_config.i */
%include "header.h"
%include "subdir1/header1.h"
%include "subdir2/header2.h"
