Friends
======================

Friend functions are recognized and wrapped accordingly.
Additionally, overloaded operators (which are usually friend members and SWIG cannot deal with them) are found by EasySwig and wrapped as common functions using following name convention:

__add__      operator+
__pos__      operator+()
__pos__      operator+() const
__sub__      operator-
__neg__      operator-()
__neg__      operator-() const
__mul__      operator*
__div__      operator/
__mod__      operator%
__lshift__   operator<<
__rshift__   operator>>
__and__      operator&
__or__       operator|
__xor__      operator^
__invert__   operator~
__lt__       operator<
__le__       operator<=
__gt__       operator>
__ge__       operator>=
__eq__       operator==
